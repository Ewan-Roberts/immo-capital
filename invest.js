I dont know why but I really overdid this, anyway: Square foot etc is all irrellevant when you're looking over 20 years. Inflation, rent of comparables, having full rooms and appriciation are the whats important here. Take the house price add yeild from renting based on room (5.4% for 2 room, 8.1% for 3 assuming full occupancy) minus compound inflation over 20 years then times by the expected appriciation.
